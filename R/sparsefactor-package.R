#' Bayesian Inference Techniques for Sparse Factor Models
#'
#' This packages provides two approaches to inference for sparse factor models: Gibbs sampling and variational inference. Additionally, a relabelling algorithm is implemented to address issues which arise from label switching and sign switching.
