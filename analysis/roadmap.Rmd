To record progress, and to organise things to do (in italics).

# Model
- Explore possible model specifications for sparse factor analysis in existing literature.
- Specify the distributions of the sparse factor model. See Section 1 of the [derivation](assets/derivation.pdf).

# MCMC
- Derive collapsed Gibbs sampling, where the regulatory weights $\mathbf{L}$ are marginalised out of the conditional distribution of the connectivity matrix $\mathbf{Z}$. See Section 2.1 of the derivation.
- Implement collapsed Gibbs sampling.
- *Apply a relabelling algorithm to address label/sign-switching.*
- *Use Empirical Bayes to estimate the sparsity hyperparameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}$.*
- *Demonstrate the need of relabelling, and the use of Empirical Bayes.*

# Variational inference
- Derive the coordinate ascent approach for a mean-field approximation. See Section 3 of the derivation.
- *Implement the coordinate ascent approach.*
- *Demonstrate that variational approximates may be inadequate in the case of multiple modes in close proximity.*
- *Address the issue of multiple modes via a Monte Carlo approach to variational inference combined with a relabelling algorithm.*

# Evaluation
- *Calculate the predictive accuracy and mean probability of the connectivity matrix $\mathbf{Z}$ under the marginal posterior distribution.*
- *For simulated datasets, investigate evaluation methods (especially for the weights and factors) used in existing literature.*
- *For real datasets, investigate evaluation methods (either by fill-in, or by ground truth) used in existing literature.*
